## Finding

Runtime audit first found `get_runtime_summary()` did not expose `produced_total`, even though the playable HUD and factory loop already tracked it. That gap is fixed.

Second audit found live turret ammo started empty even though `duo` was placed in `build_world()`. Java `ItemTurret` only fires after `hasAmmo()`/`peekAmmo()` succeed, so the playable runtime needed a source-backed bootstrap. That gap is fixed too.

Third audit found core damage was asserted in the checklist but not explicitly tracked as a runtime proof counter. The playable enemy loop already subtracted `source_unit_weapon_damage(unit_type)` from `core_health`; runtime summary now exposes `core_damage_taken_total` so MCP can prove damage application directly.

Fourth audit found player placement cost was still only implied by shared occupancy and inventory state. The playable placement path already called `can_afford(block)` and `spend_requirements(block)` from source-backed `block.properties.requirements`; runtime summary now exposes `player_placed_block_count` and `last_placed_block_requirements` so MCP can prove the player placement loop directly.

Fifth audit found the MendProjector heal loop had source-backed formulas and static tests, but no MCP proof that a placed projector repairs a damaged block in runtime. Runtime summary now exposes the healed target health and max health so MCP can prove the heal side effect directly.

Sixth audit found bullet hit damage was source-backed and turret fire was proven, but runtime still lacked MCP-visible hit telemetry. Runtime summary now exposes bullet hit count and target health before/after so MCP can prove bullet damage directly.

Root cause:

- `produced_total` was incremented in `simulate_factory()`.
- HUD displayed `produced_total`.
- `get_runtime_summary()` omitted the key.

Fix:

- Added RED test that checks `produced_total` inside the `get_runtime_summary()` body.
- Added `"produced_total": produced_total` to `get_runtime_summary()`.
- Added RED test that checks `build_world()` bootstraps `duo` ammo from source ammo metadata and exposes the bootstrap load count in runtime summary.
- Added `bootstrap_selected_turret_ammo()` and `bootstrapped_selected_turret_ammo_load_count` to seed turret ammo from first source ammo entry without hardcoding item ids.
- Added RED test that requires `core_damage_taken_total` and an explicitly typed `core_damage: float` derived from `source_unit_weapon_damage(unit_type)`.
- Added `"core_damage_taken_total": core_damage_taken_total` to `get_runtime_summary()`.
- Added RED test that requires `player_placed_block_count` and `last_placed_block_requirements` to be exposed in runtime summary.
- Added `player_placed_block_count` and `last_placed_block_requirements` to `PortGame.gd` so placement telemetry tracks player-built blocks and source-backed costs separately from initial world blocks.
- Added RED test that requires the MendProjector runtime proof to expose target health after healing and target max health.
- Added `last_mend_projector_target_health` and `last_mend_projector_target_max_health` to `PortGame.gd` and runtime summary.
- Added RED test that requires bullet hit runtime proof to expose hit count, hit damage, and target health before/after.
- Added `bullet_hit_count`, `last_bullet_hit_damage`, `last_bullet_target_health_before`, `last_bullet_target_health_after`, and `last_bullet_target_destroyed` to `PortGame.gd` and runtime summary.

- [ ] Full playable completion not claimed until broader playthrough audit closes remaining gameplay surfaces.

## Progress

- Source-slice migration: `100.00%`
- Playable audit: broader runtime still under audit, but turret ammo/fire, placement-cost, MendProjector heal, and bullet-hit paths now proven.
- Current blocker for completion claim: broader playthrough coverage, not bullet-hit, MendProjector heal, placement-cost, or turret ammo/fire.
